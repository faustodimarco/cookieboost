# This is a cookie consent widget builder

The purpose of this builder is to give the users a quick way to create their own cookie consent widget to use it in their websites just by adding the embed code generated by this web app after customizing all the fields.


## Things to improve inside the web app 

- I want to have a text editor where can I add links, underlines and italic text on the Description field.
- I want also to have a description under the title on the modal where can I add links and everything said above.
- Right now the modal has some kind of issue because when I accept all the cookies and then I open the modal from the icon, and then on the modal I click on cancel it opens me up the lateral widget again, I don't want this. If the user has already some cookies saved in the browser there is no need of opening the widget again when they click on cancel in the cookie customization modal.
- I want also the option to make every category except the necessary cookies visible or not visible in the web app functionalities.
- I want to have all the categories untoggled by default on the cookies customization modal.
